# Indexed-Dynaimc-Interaction-factors
This is a part of research thesis, 'Dynamic Interaction Factors for Design of  Pile-Groups subjected to Machine Vibrations', written by Zexin Yu in fulfilment of the master degree at UNSW.

The results were generated from the hybrid-element model and DO NOT include the main part of the code. 

The model has been developed by Dr Babak Shahbodagh.

InteractionFactor.m is for the charts of dynamic interaction factors, based on the results.


For more details on the model, please refer to
